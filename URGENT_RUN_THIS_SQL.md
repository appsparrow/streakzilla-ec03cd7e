# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Run This SQL to Fix Infinite Recursion Error

## The Problem
The app is showing infinite recursion errors because of broken RLS (Row Level Security) policies in the database.

## The Solution
Run the SQL script below in your Supabase SQL Editor to fix the database policies.

## Steps to Fix:

### 1. Open Supabase Dashboard
- Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
- Sign in to your account
- Navigate to your project: `sbxowcfafuwkzxeaspvq`

### 2. Open SQL Editor
- Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
- Click "New Query"

### 3. Run the Fix Script
Copy and paste this SQL code:

```sql
-- Fix infinite recursion in group_members RLS policies
-- The issue is that policies reference the same table they're protecting

-- Step 1: Drop all existing problematic policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Group members can view other members" ON public.group_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can update group members" ON public.group_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own memberships" ON public.group_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Members can view their own membership" ON public.group_members;

-- Step 2: Create simple, non-recursive policies (only if they don't exist)
-- Users can always view their own memberships
DO $$
BEGIN
    IF NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM pg_policies 
        WHERE tablename = 'group_members' 
        AND policyname = 'Users can view their own memberships'
    ) THEN
        CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own memberships" ON public.group_members
          FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
    END IF;
END $$;

-- Users can insert their own membership
DO $$
BEGIN
    IF NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM pg_policies 
        WHERE tablename = 'group_members' 
        AND policyname = 'Users can insert their own membership'
    ) THEN
        CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own membership" ON public.group_members
          FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
    END IF;
END $$;

-- Users can update their own membership

    ) THEN
        CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own membership" ON public.group_members
          FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
    END IF;
END $$;

-- Users can delete their own membership
DO $$

```

### 4. Test the Fix
After running the SQL, try using the app again. The infinite recursion errors should be resolved.

## What This Fix Does:
1. **Removes recursive RLS policies** that were causing infinite loops
2. **Creates simple, non-recursive policies** for basic operations
3. **Uses RPC functions** to bypass RLS for complex operations
4. **Maintains security** while avoiding recursion issues

The app should now work without the 500 errors!
